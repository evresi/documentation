# App Publication Process

## Prerequisite

You need the following registered accounts, the same one used in development machine setup:
- Apple ID
- Google Account

Depending on which platform you want to publish, you will need to have an active Google Play Developer and/or an active Apple Developer Program membership.
You can also be a member of an organization with active memberships and publish under their behalf. If that is the case, make sure you have the necessary permission to create and publish a new application.
